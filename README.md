# code-server-template
This repository uses Docker to provide 4 separate code-space servers, which gives students access to VSCode environments in a browser. 

These code-spaces can be used by teams in simple coding competitions. Each code-space server is isolated to individual groups, and allows team members to collaborate effectively. They can all write to the same files, and each team member gets their own terminal access to the container's linux environment. There is also a debugger installed, so team members can execute and debug their code line-by-line.

This is a template repository. Forks of this repository can be made, and those forks can have code pre-written to better facilitate the competitions. This allows for easy setup and customization for different coding challenges.

The defaults here are configured for [Python](https://www.python.org/) based projects, with a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) already set up and [Python extensions for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed.
